# Acronyms
The file `acronyms.tex` provides acronyms that are commonly used in my LaTeX projects. It is designed to be used with the LaTeX package ["acronym"](https://ctan.org/pkg/acronym).

To use the file `acronyms.tex` provided by this repository in Overleaf, import it as an external file using this URL: <https://github.com/johannesschrott/acronyms/raw/refs/heads/main/acronyms.tex>
Then reference it in your `main.tex` file by including the following two lines of code:

-  Before the document section: `\usepackage[nolist]{acronym}`

-  In the document section: `\input{acronyms}`
